* So problem is that we want to generate a given string **(ransomeNote)** using character of another given string **(magazine)**

* For Example :
  * ransomeNote = aa
  * magazine = aab

```
after calculating map it will look like :
```
    | char | count |
    |------|-------|
    | a    | 2     |   
    | b    | 1     |   
    
```   
now we can generate aa using 2 count of a
so we will return true
```

```
What we will do is:
    create a map of 26 size (because there is 26 alphabets)
    save frequecy count of every character of source (magazine) in map
    now iterate thorough character of our to be constructing string (ransomeNote)
        if count of char in map become 0
            then we can't generate it so return false
    now when loop is completed obviously return true
```


```
class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        int mp[26] = {};
        
        for(char c : magazine) mp[c - 'a']++;
        
        for(char c : ransomNote){
            int count = mp[c - 'a']--;
            if(count == 0)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
